# Plagiarism Detection System (IoD & UCD)

## Overview

This project involves creating three diagrams to illustrate the architecture and workflow of a plagiarism detection system using **Interaction Overview Diagram (IoD)** and **Use Case Diagram (UCD)** methodologies. The system is designed to simplify assignment submission, plagiarism detection, and grading for students and instructors.

## Documents Included

1. **IoD - Plagiarism Detection System.pdf**  
   - Contains the IoD diagram, which outlines the workflow for assignment submission, evaluation, and the integration of manual and automated code review processes.

2. **Plagiarism Detection - Combined IoD & UCD (Final).pdf**  
   - Provides a unified view of the IoD and UCD diagrams. It details the flow of assignment submission, automated testing, plagiarism scanning (e.g., using tools like Turnitin), and the generation of grades and reports.

3. **UCD - Plagiarism Detection System.pdf**  
   - Includes the UCD (Use Case Diagram) for the programming assignment system. This diagram highlights the roles of students, instructors, and the Learning Management System (LMS) in managing assignments, conducting plagiarism checks, and synchronizing grades.

## Key Features

- **Automated Code Testing:** Validates submitted code against assignment requirements.
- **Plagiarism Scanning:** Utilizes tools like Turnitin to identify copied or unoriginal content.
- **Flexible Grading:** Supports both automated and manual grading, allowing instructors to adjust grades as needed.
- **LMS Integration:** Enables seamless synchronization of final grades and reports with the university's Learning Management System.

## System Workflow

### Interaction Overview Diagram (IoD)
- **Assignment Submission:** Students upload their code through the system.
- **Automated Testing:** The system evaluates the code based on predefined criteria.
- **Plagiarism Scan:** Tools like Turnitin are employed to detect potential plagiarism.
- **Grading:** Grades are automatically calculated based on test results and plagiarism reports. Instructors can modify grades if required.
- **Report Generation:** Comprehensive reports are created for students and instructors.
- **LMS Sync:** Final grades and reports are synchronized with the university's LMS.

### Use Case Diagram (UCD)
- **Actors:**
  - **Students:** Submit assignments, view grades, and access feedback.
  - **Instructors:** Define grading criteria, review submissions, conduct plagiarism checks, and manage grades.
  - **LMS:** Stores and manages grades and reports for compliance and auditing purposes.
- **Use Cases:**
  - **Students:**
    - Submit assignments.
    - View grades and feedback.
    - Resubmit assignments (if permitted).
  - **Instructors:**
    - Define grading criteria.
    - Initiate plagiarism checks.
    - Review and adjust grades.
    - Sync grades with LMS.
  - **LMS:**
    - Store grades and reports.
    - Provide data for audits and compliance.

## Combined IoD and UCD

The combined diagram integrates the IoD and UCD to offer a comprehensive overview of the system. It highlights:
- **Inputs:** Assignment submissions, grading criteria, and deadlines.
- **Processes:** Automated testing, plagiarism scanning, and grading.
- **Outputs:** Grades, reports, and audit logs.
- **Actors:** Students, instructors, and LMS.

## Reflection

Creating these diagrams provided valuable insights into the structure and functionality of the plagiarism detection system. The IoD emphasized the flow of data and processes, while the UCD focused on the interactions between users and the system. Combining both diagrams offered a complete picture of how user inputs are transformed into meaningful outputs, ensuring efficiency and transparency in the grading process. This exercise highlighted the importance of integrating tools like Turnitin and LMS systems to uphold academic integrity and streamline workflows.
